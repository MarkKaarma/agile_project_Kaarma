    <h2>What I did:</h2>
    <p>My main part was Team lead. Also I was the "face" of the project and gave ideas of how the project should look like. 
        And created the "Profile" page together with partners.</p>
    <h2>What I enjoyed:</h2>
    <p>I enjoyed giving ideas, sketches and communication with the team.</p>
    <h2>What I found difficult:</h2>
    <p>It was difficult for me to understand React.js, also difficult to find motivation to do the code.
        And was difficult to communicate with the entire team and to keep everyone together.</p>
    <h2>Next time:</h2>
    <p>I would spend more time with the team. And I should develop communication and get rid of laziness.</p>
